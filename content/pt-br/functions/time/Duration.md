The `time.Duration` function returns a [`time.Duration`] value that you can use with any of the `Duration` [methods].

This template:

```go-html-template
{{ $duration := time.Duration "hour" 24 }}
{{ printf "There are %.0f seconds in one day." $duration.Seconds }}
```

Is rendered to:

```text
There are 86400 seconds in one day.
```

minutes|`minute`, `m`
seconds|`second`, `s`
milliseconds|`millisecond`, `ms`
