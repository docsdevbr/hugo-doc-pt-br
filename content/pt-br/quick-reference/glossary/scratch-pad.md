title: scratch pad
---

Conceptually, a _scratch pad_ is a [_map_](g) with [_methods_](g) to set, get, update, and delete values. Attach the data structure to a `Page` or `Site` object using the [`Store`](/methods/page/store/) method, or create a locally scoped scratch pad using the [`newScratch`](/functions/collections/newscratch/) function.
