title: method
---

Used within a [_template action_](g) and associated with an [_object_](g), a _method_ takes zero or more [_arguments_](g) and either returns a value or performs an action. For example, `IsHome` is a method on a `Page` object which returns `true` if the current page is the home page. See also [_function_](g).
